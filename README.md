# Crypto Rate of Growth
Calculates and compares RoG's based on user input

Uses streamlit.io as a user interface to run program \
Uses pandas.pydata.org to analyse data \
Uses requests library to ping cryptocompare.com API \
Uses cryptocompare.com for information on the latest crypto prices \n

The idea with this program is to give the user the ability to input up to 4 types of cryptos 
(ie. BTC, ETH, LTC, SHIB) and input a start date and end date.  With the given information, 
the program will calculate the rate of growth between the two given dates for all selected cryptos 
and then plot the information on a bar chart for comparison.
